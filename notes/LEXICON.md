
### Routine

A *routine* describes any sequence of instructions in a program, or the main program itself.

### Subroutine

A *subroutine* is an encapsulated set of instructions that can be invoqued from different places in a program.

### Procedure

A *procedure* is an **action-oriented** subroutine that can take one or mulitple parameters and does not return any value.

### Functions

A *function* is a **value-oriented** subroutine that can take one or mulitple parameters and return one or multiple values.

Note: the term function comes from mathematics, but a function would map more to an mathematic "application".

- **Pure functions**: A pure function has the following characteristics.
  - It is deterministic. It has the same output for a given input.
  - It does not cause any side-effects. it does not alter any state outside its scope, nor does it have any observable interaction with the outside world apart from returning a value.
- **Variadic functions**: A variadic function takes an undefined number of arguments.
